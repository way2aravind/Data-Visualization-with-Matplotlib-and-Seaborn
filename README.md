# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This repository contains code examples, explanations, and resources for creating compelling data visualizations using Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. As part of the #75DaysChallenge, this project explores advanced visualization techniques, customization options, and effective data storytelling practices.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Data visualization is essential for data analysis and interpretation. This repository covers:
- Basics of Matplotlib for simple line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.
- Introduction to Seaborn for statistical data visualization with built-in themes and color palettes.
- Advanced topics such as FacetGrid, styling, and annotations for better data insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various plots and customizations.
- `images/`: Sample images of the visualizations created.
- `data/`: Example datasets for practice.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

1. **Basic Plots with Matplotlib** - Line plot, bar chart, histogram, etc.
2. **Customizing Plots in Matplotlib** - Colors, line styles, grid, and layout adjustments.
